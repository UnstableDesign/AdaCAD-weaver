	<p>AdaCAD is a project of the <a target="_blank" href="https://unstable.design/">Unstable Design Lab</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder ATLAS Institute that aims to support the requirements of what we call "experimental weaving" but that has basic functions to support all weavers. </p>


	<h4>What is Experimental Weaving?</h4>
	<p>Experimental weaving focuses on the integration of functional components into woven structures. In one sense, this might be integrating metallic yarns to support sensing, actuation and circuity. In another, it might mean adding bio-compoments to different sections of the weave to support different material changes over time. We support these by adding special views that allow you to visualize the paths of indivdiual yarns/wires, and to design with multiple warp and weft "systems" in mind</p>

	<h4>AdaCAD is a Living Project made by Researchers</h4>
	<p>We, the developers, are not a company looking to sell our product. Instead, we found an interest in building our own tools to support our practices and want to make them usable by groups beyond our lab. Making the tools, learning weaving, and working at the intersection of craft and engineering has led us to see how craft practices (interpreted as learning from materials, cultivated skill, humble practice) can foreground new value in innovation work. Specifically, we think the deep knowledge of material and structure by fiber artists and weavers can led to new, more sustainable and symbiotic, developments of technologies in the area of soft robotics, wearable computing, and composites. Alternatively, we see how the concepts of engineering can provide a defamiliarizing lens to our weaving practices.</p> 

	<h3>AdaCAD is an Open Source Project</h3>
	 <p>We were inspired by open source projects like Processing, Arduino, and Open Frameworks and want to offer AdaCAD as an equivalent for weavers. It will take us time to realize this vision, but we are exited about it and always willing to support those who want to help</p>
